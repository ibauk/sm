ScoreMaster standalone USB stick

This USB drive contains:-

* This file - README.txt
* A folder, SM2, which contains the standalone copy of ScoreMaster.

SM2 contains two folders:

* PHP containing a standalone instance of PHP
* sm containing a standalone instance of ScoreMaster code and database

SM2 also contains:

* sm.html; an HTML document providing a browser quickstart
* StartSM.bat; an executable command to start the application

If you wish to run directly from the USB stick, run the command StartSM either
by double-clicking it in Windows Explorer or by typing 'StartSM' into a CMD
window or '.\StartSM' into a PowerShell window.

Alternatively, copy the folder SM2 to wherever you fancy having it and run it
from there.

All of the data pertaining to the rally is held in the file ScoreMaster.db so
if you want to experiment with different configurations, keep copies of that
file. The live file is always called ScoreMaster.db so you'll need to copy
and rename the files.

Have fun!
